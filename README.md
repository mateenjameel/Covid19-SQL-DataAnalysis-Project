# COVID-19 SQL Data Analysis Project

This repository contains SQL scripts for analyzing COVID-19 data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The analysis includes examining total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different locations and continents.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and is updated regularly. It includes comprehensive information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations globally.

## Project Structure

- `SQL_Covid_project.sql`: Contains SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and performing analysis.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the project.

## Setup

1. Download the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and place the CSV files in your preferred directory.
2. Run the `SQL_Covid_project.sql` script in your SQL environment.

## SQL Scripts Overview

- **Basic Data Selection and Ordering:** Retrieve and order data from the `covid_deaths` table.
- **Case and Death Analysis:** Compare total cases to deaths and calculate death percentages.
- **High Infection and Death Rates:** Identify countries with the highest infection and death rates.
- **Continent-Based Analysis:** Calculate total deaths and populations by continent.
- **Global Analysis:** Aggregate global total cases and deaths.
- **Vaccination Data Integration:** Join `covid_deaths` with `covid_vaccinations` to analyze vaccination data.
